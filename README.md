# Buddy-The-Google-Assistant-Robot
This is Buddy, Raspberry Pi based Google Assistant Robot made using Google Assistant SDK with Python
It can express 6 types of emotions:
1. Happy
2. Sad
3. Angry
4. Fear
5. Suprise
6. Blink

This robot is made using Raspberry Pi with the help of Google Assistant SDK. The Google Assistant SDK is written in Python. I have modified and made few changes in the code to detect the user query and display emotions according to it.
